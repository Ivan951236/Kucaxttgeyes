# Kucaxttgeyes
A Texture Pack (which is pronounced "Ku Caxts thy ki eyes") for JE with Caxton mod installed.

The one Texture Pack that brings Ubuntu Desktop's Fonts (Differents versions are available as different editions)

I Say Ubuntu **FONTS** because unlike the other font pack, this one actually comes with Bold and Italic fonts, which means it is the same it was before, other than it's Ubuntu instead of what I call Minecraftia Fonts

The Ubuntu Mono and the Ubuntu Sans versions are available in `.mono` and `.sans` directory respectfully
